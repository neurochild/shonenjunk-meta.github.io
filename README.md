# Shonen Junk
#### Community - Meta Hub

https://shonenjunk-meta.github.io

This project is intended to be a simple way for community to group together Shonen Junk NFTs that are unanimously accepted as desirable interms of data or visual representation.

## Rules/Guidelines for Adding New Meta
>This is open for changes as long as there is a consensus
- No single person shall have absolute power to add or remove meta
- New meta must always reflect a coherent look (Must be very easy to determine what it represents just by looking at them as a group)
- Adding to whitelist or blacklist should go through consensus (consult with owner if necessary)


## Categories
>This is open for changes as long as there is a consensus

- Armed - Any 2 or more trait combinations with a weapon/wings
- Unarmed - Any 2 or more trait combinations with no weapons/wings
- Trait Count - Grouping for Junkies based on number of traits they posses
- Color Match - Color combinations that are highly sought after
- Unique - 2 or more trait combinations that creates a very coherent look and only exists in less than 1% (90/9001) of the collection.
- Legendary - official single trait that only exists in less than 1% (90/9001) of the collection.

    "name": "Waifu w/ a Knifu",     // this will be the visible name
    "poster": 1234,                 // token id of the poster
    "story": "",                    // story/description of meta
    "traits": [                     // filter for traits

        "trait_type": "Swords & Wings"
      },
     {

        "trait_type": "Hair accessories"
      },
    ],
    "colors": {             // color filters, for matching use e.g. "match-hair": "match-eyes" will match hair with eyes
      "hair": [],                           // empty means it will match any color
      "eyes": [match-clothes],              // any eye color that match clothes
      "clothes": [],                      
      "backdrop": ["black", "yellow"],       // multiple value is allowed

    },
    "trait_count": 6,       // trait count filter can have value of 6-10
    "whitelist": [],        // skips all the rules and includes the token ids in this list
    "blacklist": []        // skips all the rules and excludes the token ids in this list
